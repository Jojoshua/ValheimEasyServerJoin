# ValheimEasyServerJoin
An easy way to configure and join Valheim servers using AutoHotkey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)

- This might not work on very small screens. Feel free to send PRs

Change the following variables under Macro1
1. Change steamDir to your steam directory if different
2. Set serverIP
3. Set serverPort
4. Set serverPassword
5. Set serverDescription (optional but nice to see if managing multiple scripts)
6. Load this script into AutoHotkey and press Alt + . to start

An example might look like...

serverIP := "1.1.1.1"
serverPort := 2456
serverPassword := "12345"
serverDescription := "Jojoshua's World"
